Shell script for cloning and compressing commonly used computer vision repositories from [OpenMMLab](https://github.com/open-mmlab) for ease of upload to kaggle and for other applications.

Feel free to open a PR if you find yourself using a repo which isn't included in the script! :sparkles:

## Usage
Simply run the shell script using `bash`, the `-r` arg can be used to remove the folder containing the repositories after compression if desired.
```
bash make_dataset.sh -r
```
**OR** use the available kaggle upload [here](https://www.kaggle.com/maxvandijck/openmmlab-essential-repositories).
